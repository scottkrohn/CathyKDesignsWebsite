	<p>I have been sewing since I was 6 years old. I made a lot of my clothes and even made my wedding dress back in 1983. Creating nice things and working with fabric has always made me happy.</p>

<p>Several years ago I got an iPad, Kindle and tablet computer. I soon realized that these fun devices were not very comfortable to hold and use without some sort of case. I bought several cases from various stores, but these mass produced cases only helped a bit. I knew there had to be a better way. Using my sewing skills, I went to work!</p>

<p>After many designs and testing, I had cases and covers that made me happy. I wanted a hardcover style so they didn't feel too floppy and flimsy. My new covers felt sturdy while holding, yet were slim, lightweight, soft, durable and very comfortable to use. Now it was time to share my creations with the World!</p>
